- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - The React UI library for faster and easier web development.
- [React ChartJS 2](http://reactchartjs.github.io/react-chartjs-2/#/) - Simple yet flexible React charting for designers & developers.
- [ChromaJS](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) - A small-ish zero-dependency JavaScript library for all kinds of color conversions and color scales.
